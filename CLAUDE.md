# matilha-ux-pack — Matilha Companion Pack

> **You lead. Agents hunt.**
> A harness for building complex projects with AI.

`matilha-ux-pack` is a Matilha companion pack — 22 UX and cognitive skills synthesized from Danilo's Obsidian wiki (Weinschenk's 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People, Krug's Don't Make Me Think, 15 neuroscience frameworks, and curated behavioral-science concept pages).

## How this loads in Claude Code

You are reading this because `matilha-ux-pack` is installed as a plugin. The Skill tool auto-invokes pack skills when their descriptions match user intent (e.g., "design a signup form" → `cog-cognitive-load` + `ux-trust-by-design` + `ux-swiss-cheese-errors`).

If `matilha-skills` (Matilha core) is also installed, its skills (`matilha-design`, `matilha-scout`, `matilha-plan`) delegate to this pack's skills automatically. If Matilha core is absent, this pack's skills still work standalone — they provide UX guidance regardless of surrounding methodology.

## Companion integration (upward)

This pack is a **specialist** invoked by Matilha core skills. It does NOT invoke other packs in this version. Future versions may delegate to `matilha-growth-pack` (when pricing-psychology decisions intersect) or `matilha-design-pack` (when visual-execution decisions intersect).
